Thank you for the detailed explanation, Shweta — this is a great start! Since your project is foundational and will impact how your team uses **S9 Composer with Content Symphony**, it's important your **Design Document** clearly explains your approach, classes, and motivations.

Below is a well-organized **Design Document draft** based on everything you said. You can share this with your team as a Google Doc or Confluence page (depending on your team's documentation practice at Amazon).

## 📄 Design Document: Java Package for Returning Creatives to S9 Composer

### 👤 Author: Shweta Prakash Jagtap

### 📁 Project: Onboarding S9 Composer with Content Symphony

---

### 1. 📌 Overview

Our team is initiating onboarding to **S9 Composer** to integrate with **Content Symphony** as infrastructure-as-code. This will enable:

* Creatives to go through **Code Review (CR)**, reducing human errors.
* **Creative history tracking** via version control.
* Simplified **expansion to new regions and marketplaces**.
* Easier **updates and maintenance** of creatives.

My task is to build a **Java package** that returns a list of creatives to the S9 Composer. This document proposes the design for that package and seeks feedback from the team.

---

### 2. 🎯 Goals

* Provide a **modular, strategy-based Java package** that generates creatives.
* Leverage CR and diff tools (`brazil-build composer diff`) to manage creative lifecycle.
* Ensure flexibility to support different **strategies**, **regions**, and **marketplaces**.
* Facilitate **easy onboarding of new creatives** through config files (JSON-based).

---

### 3. 🧱 Key Concepts

#### 🧩 What is a Creative?

A **Creative** determines:

* **Where**, **when**, and **to whom** a content should be shown.
* **How** to get and render the content (e.g., RemoteService, filters, processing, etc.).

Sample creative construction looks like:

```java
Creative creative = new Creative("displayName")
  .withContent(new Content(...) 
    .withRemoteContent(new RemoteContent()
      .withCandidateGeneration(...)
      .withCandidateProcessing(...)))
  .withPlacement(new Placement(...));
```

---

### 4. 🧠 High-Level Design

#### 🔹 Main Entry Class: `GamutComposerV1`

* Extends `Composer` base class.
* Implements `build()` method to:

  * Initialize all strategies.
  * Get list of creatives per strategy.
  * Aggregate all creatives into a single list and return.

```java
@Override
public List<Creative> build() {
    List<Creative> allCreatives = new ArrayList<>();
    for (Strategy strategy : initializedStrategies) {
        allCreatives.addAll(strategy.getCreatives());
    }
    return allCreatives;
}
```

---

### 5. 🏗️ Package Structure and Key Classes

#### 1️⃣ `GeneralCreative` (Abstract Base Class)

* Common fields: `accessControlGroup`, `businessGroup`, `marketingType`, etc.
* Abstract methods:

  * `buildCreative()`
  * `buildContent()`
  * `buildPlacement()`
* Utility methods:

  * `setGeneralCreativeAttributes()`
  * `buildCandidateGeneration(strategyContextKey, dbKeys)`
  * `buildCandidateProcessing(endIndex, filters)`

#### 2️⃣ Strategy-Specific Classes (e.g., `BookBlendsRecentGenre`)

* Extend `GeneralCreative`.
* Implement overrides based on strategy logic and data.
* Parse respective strategy’s config file and return a list of creatives.

#### 3️⃣ `KSSHelper`

* Helps in setting up **RemoteContent** section which is shared across all creatives.
* Method: `setGeneralKssContent(region)`
* Fields set: `serviceName`, `cti`, `authProtocol`, `url`, etc.

#### 4️⃣ `ConfigurationDirectory`

* JSON files per strategy:

  * Contains creative-specific values like `displayName`, `description`, `filters`, `region`, `placement rules`, etc.
* Used to externalize creative config for easier updates.

---

### 6. ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Brazil build triggers** the `build()` method in `GamutComposerV1`.
2. Each initialized strategy is looped over:

   * `getCreatives()` reads its JSON config.
   * For each creative in config:

     * Constructed using `GeneralCreative`, `KSSHelper`, and strategy-specific logic.
3. All creatives are collected and returned to Composer.
4. `composer diff` generates the diff.
5. Team reviews → CR → Merge → Composer pipeline applies changes.

---

### 7. 📈 Benefits

* Strategy-driven creative generation supports **experiments across pages/regions**.
* Configuration-driven setup makes it **easy to onboard new creatives**.
* Reuse through `GeneralCreative` and `KSSHelper` promotes **clean code and consistency**.
* JSON configs are scalable and **trackable via Git**.

---

### 8. ⚠️ Open Questions / Feedback Areas

* Is this strategy-based breakdown acceptable for our long-term scale?
* Should the JSON config schema be further modularized?
* Any suggestions on improving `GeneralCreative` abstraction?
* Should I consider loading configs using `Jackson` or any internal tools?
* Any guidelines on diff file naming or approval thresholds?

### 🔚 Conclusion

This document outlines a proposed structure for the Java package to integrate with S9 Composer using Content Symphony. Feedback from the team will help improve the design before implementation.
